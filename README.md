  <h2>Banking Amigo</h2>
</p>

Banking Amigo is a financial education tool catered towards young girls between the age of 10 to 15. Our fun, encouraging, and knowledgeable avatar Erika acts as reliable friend and financial mentor who guides the user through interactive scenarios of choosing a bank, bank accounts, and spending and saving their money.

## Inspiration âœ¨

When we were teenagers, we were overwhelmed with all the different banks, accounts and didn't know where to start. We wish we had a friend that could help us walk through some of the confusing banking terms, provide us with easy-to-follow tips to guide us.

And we are not alone in feeling this way.

Financial literacy is globally recognized as an [essential life skill](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-2015-results-volume-iv_9789264270282-en;jsessionid=e9NkhlsApFk8Pmw38RWJX2eZ.ip-10-240-5-30). But, only [One in seven students](https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-education/many-15-year-olds-struggle-with-financial-literacy-according-to-oecd-pisa-report.htm) in many modern countries are unable to make even simple decisions on everyday spending. Kids and teenagers are not properly introduced to financial concepts through [formal education](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/financial-capability-literacy/facts#_ftn3). A [majority of teens want to learn about finance](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/financial-capability-literacy/facts#_ftn3), but find current methods difficult to navigate.

This is exactly what we want to accomplish with Banking Amigo.

A recap of the concepts and terms covered is provided at the end of the narrative to reiterate and emphasis learnings.


## How we built it

We brainstormed and planned the abstractions before the actual implementations. We drafted our first prototype using Figma.com. We built the front-end interface with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We used custom fonts from Google. We built the back-end using Javascript and Express. Finally, the app was deployed with github.com.


## Challenges we ran into

One challenge we faced is to figure out how to put our abstract ideas into concrete implementation. We found that not being able to see each other in person makes it hard to communicate our visions. Drawing pictures and story boards helped us make our ideas more concrete and made the implementation easier.

Given our younger audience group, we also had to make sure that the story narrative and content we were creating is applicable to our target audience. We had to pay special attention to the tone we wanted to set and the language used in order to most effectively explain concepts to younger girls.

Some of our members were completely new to HTML, CSS, and other front end technologies. It was difficult for her to first onboard the technical portion of the project. But, with the help and guidance of other teammates she was able to familiarize herself with the basics and contribute to the codebase.

## What we learned

We learned that when developing for a certain audience, it is important to always keep our audience in mind and see things from their perspective. This way we would be able to develop programs that truly cater to the target audience. We also learned that planning, visualizing, and strategizing before starting on the code is crucial. Any time spent on the preparation phase is not time wasted and will ultimately save us tremendous time and effort. We also felt that we were able to create a better and more appealing end product because of the time we spent planning and seeking to see things from our target audience's perspectives.
